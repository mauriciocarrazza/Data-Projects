# Data-Science-Projects
Welcome to my repository. Here you will find a series of projects about data science using Python, SQL and Tableau. Projects can be part of competitions, university work, tech interviews or own initiatives. Among the techniques developed are: data importing, cleaning, analysis and visualization; probability, statistics, machine learning and programming. <br />

Some projects consist of more than file, so they are located in a single folder. <br />

The "guided_projects" folder contain all of the notebooks for each guided project. <br />

All of the avalable datasets from each project can be located in the "datasets" folder. <br />

## Mar-2023 - (Tech Interview) - Soccer Leagues Analysis and Machine Learning Models Evaluation
Project from a technical interview that consists of two sections: The first one is a data processing and analysis of the Top 5 Soccer Leagues in Europe using Python's pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. The second one uses a wine dataset and consists of an EDA and evaluation of differents techniques used in Machine Learning. <br />

## Jan-2023 - (Tech Interview) - Analysis on Professional Profiles in Tech
This project was a challenge to be admitted at a company for a Data Analyst Role. It consists of two sections: The first one is a data processing and analysis on tech profiles using Python and Tableau. The second one is the development of a classification model to optimize the hiring process of tech talents. I'm not sharing the datasets for this project. This project contain 4 files: the Jupyter Notebook with the code answer, a PDF with the challenge instructions, a Tableau workbook with some visualizations of the answers and a Power Point presentation to the stakeholders <br />

## Apr-2022 - (Internship Project) - Database creation for Water Treatment Processes
Developed my chemical engineering degree project entitled "Effective use and control of water in a cosmetic manufacturer" (Earned a final industry grade of 48/50). The folder contains the final doc presented to the university. All of the information about the project development is found in the chapter #6.
- Designed a database for the control of water's microbiological analysis and physicochemical properties (Microsoft Excel). This tool made it possible to increase decision making effectiveness about water treatment and reduce disinfection costs by 40%.
- Developed the techniques to measure water consumption and created data visualizations (Python). These both helped to improve the company's production planning process. <br />
