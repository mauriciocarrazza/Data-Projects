# Python-Projects
Welcome to my repository. Here you will find a series of projects about data science using Python, SQL and Tableau. Projects can be part of courses, competitions, university work or own initiatives. Among the techniques developed are: data importing, cleaning, analysis and visualization; probability, statistics, machine learning and programming. <br />

Some projects consist of more than file, so they are located in a single folder. <br />

## Soccer Leagues Analysis and Machine Learning Models Evaluation
Project from a technical interview that consists of two sections: The first one is a data processing and analysis of the Top 5 Soccer Leagues in Europe using Python's pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. The second one uses a wine dataset and consists of an EDA and evaluation of differents techniques used in Machine Learning. <br />

## Analysis on Professional Profiles in Tech
This project was a challenge to be admitted at a company for a Data Analyst Role. It consists of two sections: The first one is a data processing and analysis on tech profiles using Python and Tableau. The second one is the development of a classification model to optimize the hiring process of tech talents. I'm not sharing the datasets for this project. This project contain 4 files: the Jupyter Notebook with the code answer, a PDF with the challenge instructions, a Tableau workbook with some visualizations of the answers and a Power Point presentation to the stakeholders <br />
